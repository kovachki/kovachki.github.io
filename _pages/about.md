I am currently a final-year PhD student in applied mathematics at Caltech working on machine learning methods for the
physical sciences in theory and practice. I work in collaboration with my advisor Prof. <a href="http://stuart.caltech.edu/">Andrew M. Stuart</a>
and have also collaborated with various experts in the fields of machine learning and physical modeling including Prof. <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/">Anima Anandkumar</a>,
Prof. <a href="https://mechmat.caltech.edu/">Kaushik Bhattacharya</a>, Prof. <a href="https://maartendehoop.rice.edu/">Maarten V. de Hoop</a>, 
Prof. <a href="https://uqgroup.mit.edu/">Youssef Marzouk</a>, Prof. <a href="https://millergroup.caltech.edu/Miller_Group/Home.html">Tom Miller</a>, and Prof. <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/sam/the-institute/people/siddhartha-mishra.html">Siddhartha Mishra</a>. I am originally from 
 Sofia, Bulgaria but have lived in the US since 2005 (Atlanta &rarr; LA). I received a B.Sc. in mathematics from Caltech in 2016. I am a recipient of the 
 2020 <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/honors#amazon">Amazon AI4Science Fellowship</a> which recognizes the outstanding work of graduate students
 in machine learning that impacts other scientific fields. My work has been written about in popular science magazines:
 <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/30/1011435/ai-fourier-neural-network-cracks-navier-stokes-and-partial-differential-equations/">MIT Technology Review</a>, 
 <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/latest-neural-nets-solve-worlds-hardest-equations-faster-than-ever-before-20210419/">Quanta Magazine</a>. 

My broader interest include anything mathematically beautiful or machine learning related.
In particular, I am excited about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14501.pdf">approximation theory</a> of neural networks, the
application of data-driven techniques to <a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10083845/7/Arridge_Solving%20inverse%20problems%20using%20data-driven%20models_VoR.pdf">inverse problems</a>, 
the theory and application of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08481.pdf">operator learning</a> techniques for imaging and the computational
sciences, and the development of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05023.pdf">uncertainty quantification</a> techniques with deep neural
networks. I am also interested in the large-scale deployment and integration of learning systems in 
super computers for more efficient physical simulations or in computationally limited hardware 
for consumer and commercial products.

I love spending my free time outdoors whenever possible. I particularly 
enjoy hiking, mountain biking, snowboarding, surfing, and skateboarding.
I've also recently become an avid runner. Indoors, I love experimenting 
with new cooking techniques (recently fermentation), experiencing all forms of 
art and music and badly attempting to create my own, and exploring LA for 
new food and coffee. Last but certainly not least, I love spending time 
with my <a href="/assets/img/nik_shushi.jpg" target="_blank">amazing dog.</a>

 <i>I am currently on the job market!</i> Please find my <a href="/assets/pdf/kovachki_cv.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> and contact me if you think I'd be a good fit for your team.
